> When I first started exploring the CI/CD and the SSGs, the first generator that I learned was Jekyll. I used [Getting started with the Documentation Theme for Jekyll](https://idratherbewriting.com/documentation-theme-jekyll/) by Tom Johnson, the famous guru of technical writing known by his [I'd Rather Be Writing blog](https://idratherbewriting.com/).

So without too many words, let's start building our first documentation portal using Tom's Jekyll theme. I will try to explain even the evident things.

## Download or clone the theme from the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/tomjoht/documentation-theme-jekyll)

1. Sign up for GitHub.

3. Now if you follow the [link to Tom's repo](https://github.com/tomjoht/documentation-theme-jekyll), you will see the contents of this repo that has the code and content for his example [documentation site](https://idratherbewriting.com/documentation-theme-jekyll/).

4. Click the **Code** button and select **Download ZIP**.

5. Save the ZIP file to your computer and unzip the contents where you like. Now you have the folder with code and content. Let's proceed with building our documentation site from all this.
